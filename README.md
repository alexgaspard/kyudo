# kyudo
Internal tool to give feedback and ideas anonymously to improve team work. 
Because "you propose it, you own it" prevents free feedback to improve processes. 

# Concepts 
* simple webserver with users able to post proposals
* users and original poster can add comments to a proposal
* all users cannot see who is who, completely anonymous to users except for Admin 
* Admin must be outside of the team, cannot post proposal nor comment by design 
* Admin can request identity of a user for a specific proposal or comment, to prevent hate or personal blame 
* maybe create an optional role of manager to settle proposals, depending on the team organization. Can be completely democratic to follow agile principles where the team manages itself 
* users can up/downvote for proposals 

# Technical ideas
* hexagonal architecture
* no id in dB, only composite keys, ids generated by backend, eg. hash of composite key 
* use majority judgment to vote for proposals
